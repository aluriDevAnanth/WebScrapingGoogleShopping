# WebScrapingGoogleShopping
This repository contains a Python script that can scrape Google Shopping for any given search query and save the extracted data in Excel and JSON formats.
The script uses a config file to specify the parameters for the web scraping, such as the search query, the number of results to scrape.
The script uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to fetch and parse the HTML pages from Google Shopping, and the openpyxl and json libraries to write the data to Excel and JSON files.
The data that is scraped includes the product name, price, link, supplier, delivery. The script can be run from the command line or imported as a module in other Python programs.
The script is useful for anyone who wants to collect and analyze data from Google Shopping for research or personal purposes.
